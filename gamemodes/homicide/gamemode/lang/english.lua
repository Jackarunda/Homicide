	"The shuriken is not a killing weapon. It is useful for poisoning and for chipping away at someone who's out of reach.",

	"Items spawn all around the map for bystanders to use. Food, weapons, building materials, etc.",
	"If items aren't spawning on your map, contact the author, Jackarunda, so he can investigate and improve the spawning algorithm.",
	"It you spawn often in walls on your map, contact the author, Jackarunda, so he can investigate and improve the spawning algorithm.",
	"If you spawn stuck in something, try crouching (to move your collision hull) or punching with your fists to nudge yourself.",
	"Shot placement counts. Limb shots don't do much health damage, though they have other effects.",
	"Being shot in the legs causes temporary immobilization.",
	"Being shot in the arms forces you to fumble your weapon (switch to hands).",
	"Eating food grants a stamina regen bonus and also allows you to slowly regenerate health.",
	"Bandages only stop bleeding; they don't restore health.",
	"If you can't reach a particular ledge, try punching the wall downward to give yourself an upward boost while crouch-jumping.",
	"The murderer has many ways to poison people: injection, item contact, weapon strike and food poisoning.",
	"If you can't jump or walk, you're probably exhausted. Just sit still for a moment and let your stamina (flashing bar) regenerate.",
	"Drawing the fake pistol will likely expose you as the murderer if you do it too soon. Drop the thing instead to act as bait.",
	"The silenced pistol shoots a .22LR, a very weak round. Headshots are the shots of choice for this weapon.",
	"When stabbing, the murderer immobilizes victims, preventing them from turning or moving. Don't get caught.",
	"There are many weapons that bystanders can use to defend themselves. Bats, pocket knives, fists, etc.",
	"The axe and hatchet can only be used by the murderer.",
	"The hatchet is the only throwing weapon that can easily deal lethal damage to someone.",
	"The axe can actually break down map doors with enough swings.",
	"Duct tape and hammer/nails can be used to seal map doors, though it uses a lot of tape/nails.",

	"You can be punished for RDMing even if you don't kill anyone. Repeated punching over multiple rounds can get you in trouble.",

	"Loot only spawns in places where players aren't. If you want loot, move around the map and find places where no one is.",
	"The police will shoot the murderer and anyone else who has a weapon drawn, even fists.",
	"The national guardsmen will shoot the traitor and anyone else who attacks an innocent while they're around.",
	"Rejoining a server does NOT reset your RDM guilt. Guilt is stored per steam-ID.",
	"Turning on sv_cheats disables RDM penalties and anticheat features (good for messing around or making videos).",

	"Your RDM offenses are forgiven over time. Go an entire round without losing your innocence and you get bonus forgiveness.",
	"The IED isn't terribly lethal on its own. Put it in something that'll fragment, like a metal container.",
	"As the traitor/murderer, you start with more gear than bystanders. Don't give yourself away by showing it too early.",
	"Just because someone has additional gear or items doesn't mean they're the murderer. Items can be found around the map all the time.",
	"The curare poison can be applied to any bladed weapon. The first person struck with the poisoned weapon will die after a while.",
	"The VX poison can be applied to any pick-up-able item. The first person who touches the poisoned item will die after a while.",
	"The batrachotoxin needle can be used to quietly prick someone from behind. The poisoned person will die after a while.",
	"The tetrodotoxin poison can be mixed into any food or drink lying around. Anyone who eats the item will die after a while.",
	"The door wedge can be used to completely block a door from one side.",
	"Can't jump high enough? Just chill for a minute. Let your stamina regenerate.",
	"A basic understanding of aerobic stamina/fatigue is necessary to effectively flee from the murderer.",

	"Localized chaos can break out after natural disasters, especially in 2nd and 3rd world countries. This is a state of emergency.",
	"Gun-Free-Zone mode is similar to a hunt or a deadly game of hide-and-seek.",
	"Some State-of-Emergency rounds will be Bonus Deathmatch rounds, where it's a classic free-for-all gunfight with increased rewards.",
	"Wild-West mode is where everyone has a gun, even the murderer.",
	"In Jihad Mode, a suicidal lunatic is trying to blow everyone up.",
	"The longer you spin the grappling hook, the further you will throw it.",
	"The grappling hook must come to rest upon something in order to anchor. Listen for the anchoring sound before climbing the rope.",
	"If you rapel down from somewhere using a grappling hook, you'll have to leave it behind.",
	"The grappling hook's rope does not have collision or hang around corners. This is simply a limitation of GMod.",
	"Pull the grappling hook's rope taut in mid-flight to get it to land where you want.",
	"If you spawn stuck in something, aim where you want to go and use the *unstick chat command. You only get one try per round.",
	"The *unstick chat command can get you free from being stuck in the map. You can only do it once per round, though.",
	"People can hide inside large containers by pressing RMB+E. Deadly prophunt.",
	"While hiding inside an object, you can nudge the object in different directions with WASD.",
	"The Zyklon-B poison gas canister will contaminate an area for about 4 minutes.",
	"Poison gas is less deadly in wide open spaces and more deadly in small enclosed spaces.",
	"Poison gas will expand to fill rooms and will flow down hallways. Closing doors is a good way to contain the gas.",
	"The poison gas canister can easily poison the murderer if he isn't careful to avoid the area he placed it in.",
	"Pro-tip: hide the poison gas canister where it won't be found, like behind furniture. The gas will fill the room all the same.",
	"The murderer can silence his own footsteps by holding ALT.",
	"Don't use your scroll wheel to change weapons, noob, use your number keys.",
	"Your number keys change weapons much faster than your scrollwheel. Learn to play computer games.",
